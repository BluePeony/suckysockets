The suckysockets gem provides the user with the opportunity to check whether a power adapter is needed when travelling from one country to another.

1. How to install the gem

Prerequisites:
  - ruby (v>=2.3.3)
  - RubyGems package manager

To install the gem type 'gem install suckysockets' in your terminal.

2. How to use it
To run the program just type 'suckysockets' in the command line. 

You will be asked in which country you currently live. Please type the country name and press 'enter'. 
Next you need to enter your destination country and press 'enter' again.
Then you receive the result telling you whether or nor you need an adapter travelling from you current country to the destination country. 

Three outcomes are possible:
  - an adapter is not needed. That is the case when all plugs common in your country of living fit all of the sockets in your destination country.
  - an adapter is definetely needed. That is the case when none of the plugs in your home country fit any of the sockets in your destination country.
  - an adapter is needed in certain cases: when some of your home country plugs fit some of the sockets, but some plugs don't. In that case you will get a detailed response telling you for which particular cases an adapter is needed.
